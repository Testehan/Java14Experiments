JDK 14 new features

    1. JEP 358: Helpful NullPointerExceptions
        Summary
            Improve the usability of NullPointerExceptions generated by the JVM by describing precisely which variable was null.

        Description
            The JVM throws a NullPointerException (NPE) at the point in a program where code tries to dereference a null
            reference. By analyzing the program's bytecode instructions, the JVM will determine precisely which variable was
            null, and describe the variable (in terms of source code) with a null-detail message in the NPE. The null-detail
            message will then be shown in the JVM's message, alongside the method, filename, and line number.

    2. JEP 361: Switch Expressions
        see the Java12Experiments project for this....in version 14 they officiated the feature
